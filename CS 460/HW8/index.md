### Homework 8

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Be able to write a MVC web application that uses a multi-table, relational database instance that you created
2. Be able to create models with foreign keys and navigation properties
3. Be able to implement CRUD functionality with non-trivial models
4. Learn to write more complex T-SQL scripts to create more complex database tables
5. Practice more LINQ
6. Implement custom attribute checking


**Overall Requirements:**

 * You must use a “Code First with an Existing Database” workflow
 * Use a script to create your tables, populate them with sample data and another to delete them; the script(s) need to be added and committed to your git repository
 * All pages must use strongly typed views
 * Use only fluent (dot notation) LINQ syntax
