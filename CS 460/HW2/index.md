### Homework 2

Homework 2 is based off of [homework 1](https://tapiad.github.io/CS%20460/HW1/). This time we are not only using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, we have implemented Javascript and jQuery. We are to include multiple form elements of different types, and we are required to have a user input and action whether its by clicking on a button or selecting on a radio button, ect. It applies to use jQuery to modify one or more elements; add new elements, one of which must be a list or a tbale with multiple of child elements. On top of all this we need to demonstrate using Git `branch`, `checkout`; `merge`.


### Step 1: The Branch and the Checkout

Before creating the branch I created a new folder in my Git repository named *HW2*. In that folder I created another folder for the website files called *website*. In that folder I created an *index.html* file with a stylesheet (*styles.css*). 
Here you can I created a branch called `hw2-file`. I tried to be creative... After creation of the branch I used `git checkout` to have the head to hw2-file. At the end of it I simply checked if head is pointing towards `hw2-file` by executing `git branch`.  

<!-- branch/checkout -->
```bash
git branch hw2-file
git checkout hw2-file
git branch
* hw2-file
  master
```


### Step 2: Wireframe Mockup

This step of the homework we are to make a blue-print-like design of our website. We labeled out our design using classes like `container`, `row`, and `column`. I created my wirframe using an application called *Pencil*.
