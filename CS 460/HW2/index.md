### Homework 2

Homework 2 is based off of [homework 1](https://tapiad.github.io/CS%20460/HW1/). This time we are not only using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, we have implemented Javascript and jQuery. We are to include multiple form elements of different types, and we are required to have a user input and action whether its by clicking on a button or selecting on a radio button, ect. It applies to use jQuery to modify one or more elements; add new elements, one of which must be a list or a tbale with multiple of child elements. On top of all this we need to demonstrate using Git `branch`, `checkout`; `merge`.
