 to create a complex web application from scratch -- including database,
 CRUD functionality and some AJAX -- so that I can practice and get a 
good grade on the exam."

						<h4>Questions/Tasks:</h4>
						<p>There are <strong>Artists</strong>.  They paint, sketch, sculpt, draw, ... to produce <strong>ArtWorks</strong>.  People like to categorize works of art into various categories, which we'll call <strong>Genres</strong>; these categorizations can be called <strong>Classifications</strong>.  Artists produce many works of art. Works of art can be classified under multiple genres (examples follow).  </p>
						
						<ol>
						   <li>Create a new MVC application in your homework Git repository.  Do all your work for this homework in a new feature branch.</li>
							<li><p>Begin with the domain model.  There are four entities: <strong>Artist</strong>, <strong>ArtWork</strong>, <strong>Genre</strong> and <strong>Classification</strong>. <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW8_tables.html">This page</a>
 explains the relations between entities and provides seed data.  All 
relations must be present as named constraints in your database schema. 
 Draw or generate an E-R diagram of your database schema.</p>
							
							<p>Write an UP and a DOWN script (in App_Data) to create and destroy the database in LocalDB or SQLServer.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Using your UP script (in App_Data), seed the data above into your database tables.</li>
							<li>Place a menu item on the shared layout to select one of three
 views: Artists, ArtWorks and Classifications.  Each of these views 
should show all artists, works of art and classifications, respectively,
 that are in the database.  i.e. they are each a list view.  Also add a 
home page with some form of a welcome.</li>
						   <li>Commit your work to your local Git repository now.  This is
 so that you can show at least one commit on your development branch for
 your in-progress work.</li>
							<li><p>Implement CRUD functionality for Artists.</p><p>Here are the 5 items needed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Artist Index/List page</li>
								<li>Artist Create page (<strong>C</strong>reate)</li>
								<li>Artist Details page (<strong>R</strong>ead)</li>
								<li>Artist Edit page (<strong>U</strong>pdate)</li>
								<li>Artist Delete page (<strong>D</strong>elete)</li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Add attribute checking to the Artist Edit page to make sure 
that no attributes are optional, the Name must be no longer than 50 
characters and the birthdate cannot be in the future.</li>
							<li>Add buttons to the home page, one for every Genre.  Use a 
Razor foreach loop to create the buttons.  When a button is clicked, all
 the works of art that are classified under that Genre are displayed in a
 table or list on the main page (replacing any that were there from 
previously clicking a button).  Display the artwork title and artists 
name, sorted by title.  You must retrieve and display this data using 
AJAX.</li>
							<li>That's it; put it in your Portfolio!</li>
