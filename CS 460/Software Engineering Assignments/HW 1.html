					"As a soon-to-be professional software developer I want a simple 
web page that is nicely styled with CSS so that I can show off my 
knowledge of two of the foundational languages of modern web development
 -- HTML and CSS --  to my instructor and potential employers.  Also, I 
want to show how I use Git for source version control by making my code 
open source and available through a public Git repository."
				</p>
				<div class="questions">
					<h4>Questions/Tasks:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Download and install the <em>command line version</em> of the 
Git version control system if you don't already have it.  All code you 
write from now on (for the entire year!) must be added and committed to 
your repository.  For this term I recommend that you make just one 
repository for all your work.  Inside this repo/folder each assignment 
is its own folder.  So you'll have one repo and within it folders for 
HW1, HW2, etc.</li>
						<li>Create an account on GitHub or Bitbucket.  (We'll use 
Bitbucket exclusively Winter and Spring for our group projects, but 
we'll use GitHub for part of our work this term -- so you'll end up 
needing both.)  Get yourself set up and synchronize your local 
repository so you're ready to develop.  Once set up your workflow will 
be: 
							<ul>
								<li> on your development machine, create and edit source code files</li>
								<li> <code>add</code> them</li>
								<li> when ready, <code>commit</code>, then </li>
								<li> when you are ready to save or share your code, <code>push</code> to your remote repository</li>
							</ul>  You're the only developer so you don't have to worry about
 anyone else modifying your repository.  Or do you?  If you work on two 
machines (a laptop and a desktop) then you are effectively two 
developers working on the same code.  This is what Git excels at 
(distributed development) but you'll learn that as we go along.  For 
now, don't ever edit the files on different machines without first <code>pull</code>ing changes and only then <code>add</code>/<code>commit</code>/<code>push</code>.</li>
						<li>Write a multi-page, hyperlinked set of web pages on a subject 
of your choice.  The content is irrelevant, it's the HTML and CSS that 
matters.  Here are some specific requirements for your work:
							<ul>
								<li> You must use Bootstrap for the layout of all pages and must
 demonstrate both single column layout and two or more column formatting</li>
								<li> You must have a separate CSS file (e.g. <samp>styles.css</samp>) in which you write some of your own classes and that you use somewhere</li>
								<li> You'll need a navigation bar or menu that contains links to all your pages</li>
								<li> You need to have at least one table</li>
								<li> and one of each kind of list: <code>ol</code>, <code>ul</code> and <code>dl</code></li>
								<li> All main elements need to be styled consistently: use those
 defined by Bootstrap or use your own.  But please, no obnoxious colors 
or backgrounds.  You should attempt to make a professional and modern 
looking web page.</li>
								<li>You must write all code yourself and may not use a WYSIWYG 
designer such as Dreamweaver.  Good (free) HTML and CSS aware editors 
include Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio Code, Notepad++ and Textmate (OS X
 only)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>When finished to your liking, make sure all changes are 
committed and pushed to your remote repository.  Make a note of the 
"clone" URL of your remote repo.  You should be able to <code>clone</code> your repo to your P drive (or to another location or server) and then open the main <code>.html</code> file (i.e. <code>index.html</code>) and view your pages correctly.</li>
                        <li>Create a repository on GitHub and enable the
 GitHub Pages feature.  (If you've already used GitHub for your main 
repository then simply enable the Pages feature.)  This gives you a 
normal Git repository that is accessed by a web server.  You can then 
use this web server to view your homework's html pages on a public 
server.  More importantly, it will also serve as your <strong>Portfolio</strong>
 this term.  It will showcase all your work.  You'll want it to look 
very nice, as it is public and it has your name on it.  Future employers
 may see it!  Make a nice landing page that has your name and then a 
link to a CS 460 landing page.  This CS 460 page should have links to 
separate pages for each homework.  For each homework you'll have one or 
more pages that showcase your work, and include all your code.  They 
should be written in a Blog post kind of way.  Include written 
explanations of what you're trying to accomplish and then include both 
your code and links to the working pages.  </li>
                        <li>Create a Blog, Post or Journal entry type 
page within your Pages repository where you show off your work for this 
homework.  Here is one example: <a href="https://morses.github.io/">morses.github.io</a>
 (see Homework 1).  You should describe the assignment and then dive 
into your solution.  You must have all your code showing on the page and
 it should use syntax highlighting.  If you're using a separate 
repository (on Bitbucket for example) then make sure you have included a
 link to that repo and that it is publicly available.  The HTML and CSS 
you write for this HW is ideal for posting on GitHub Pages.  Add your 
code directly to the repo and their web server will serve it for you.  
Just include a link to your <code>index.html</code> page somewhere obvious.</li>
                        <li>Print out the grading rubric for this 
homework, write your name and the URL of your GitHub Pages site, and 
turn it in to the instructor.  The instructor will grade your work by 
reading your GitHub Pages site and reviewing your repository.</li>
						<li>Lastly, begin assembling a collection of cheat sheets, useful 
notes, important documentation and code snippets.   Print in color and 
use tabs or other such dividers to keep it nicely organized.  Include 
notes from when you were learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Git.  Your 
notes can be handwritten.   This is for your reference as you progress 
through the term, <emph>and you can bring it to the exams!</emph></li>

                    <p>Please think about why you are doing this work: 
to avoid this class's version of Technical Debt!  Maybe call it Skills 
Debt.  Later on you will need to be using Git, HTML and CSS on a daily 
basis.  You need to learn it now.  If you skimp now and don't learn it 
then you'll be in "debt" and have to "pay" it off later by "spending" 
time to learn it. But later on you won't have the time to learn it 
because you'll need that time to learn something else, like LINQ 
queries, T-SQL or Git pull requests.  Pay it off now and stay within 
budget! </p>
