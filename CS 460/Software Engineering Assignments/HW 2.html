					"As a software engineering student I want a dynamic webpage that 
does something useful so I can show off my Javascript and jQuery skills.
  Specifically, I want a nice looking webpage that uses text inputs, 
radio buttons, drop-downs, or whatever to take information from the 
user, do some calculations with Javascript and return the answer to the 
user by modifying and adding to what's on the page."
				</p>
				<div class="questions">
					<h4>Questions/Tasks:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Create a new folder in your Git repository, preferably named <samp>HW2</samp>.  Create a new feature branch for your work on this homework, check it out and proceed.  Create an <samp>index.html</samp> and stylesheet (e.g. <samp>styles.css</samp>)
 directly in that folder.  Write your CSS in this stylesheet file.  You 
can write the Javascript directly in the html file if you want.</li>
						<li><p>Think for a bit about what you'd like to do.  You need to 
take input from the user, do some calculation and then provide the 
output/answer back to the user by modifying elements on the page and 
adding new elements.</p>  <p>Here's an example that is too easy: a page 
that lets the user convert a temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit.  In 
this example you'd need a text input for the Celsius temperature, a 
"Convert" button and a location for the output like a paragraph element 
with "Answer: " text.  When the button is pressed, your Javascript 
callback function is executed which uses jQuery to retrieve the 
temperature, plain Javascript to calculate the correct temperature in 
Fahrenheit and then jQuery to change the text in that paragraph element.</p> <p>This
 example, however, isn't good enough because it only uses two form 
elements and doesn't create a list or table element.  (There's another 
example linked from the main class page that is a little closer.  It 
generates a table but only uses one input element, doesn't use Bootstrap
 and can be broken -- try a date that is clearly out of range.)</p>
						<p>Do something fun, not too complicated, and interesting.</p></li>
						<li>Create a wireframe mockup of your page to help you with the 
design.  A good idea is to overlay with the rows and columns of your 
selected Bootstrap grid, and plan for how it will look when the page is 
resized.  Label it with with the <code>container</code>, <code>row</code>, and column classed elements to visualize your layout.</li>
						<li>Create your working page, remembering to style it nicely and 
to use Bootstrap for your layout.  Recall that you'll need a minimum of 2
 files: <samp>index.html</samp> and <samp>styles.css</samp> for example and a <samp>*.js</samp> file if you feel like putting your javascript in a separate file also. </li>
						<li>Commit and push your work frequently on your feature branch 
but don't merge until you are happy with it and have tested it 
thoroughly.  For example, it should not fail if you're expecting a 
number and the user types in an arbitrary string.  A feature branch 
should continue until the feature is finished <b>and tested</b> before merging into  any main release branch.</li>
						<li>Finally, merge your feature branch back into master and push to your remote repository.</li>
						<li>Everything goes into your Portfolio: html + javascript, css, 
nicely commented of course, a screenshot of the rendered webpage, your 
wireframe mockup, the working page and any notes you've generated. (You 
are keeping notes of what you're learning, right?)</li>

                    <h3>Important</h3>
					<p>Now is the time to learn the correct workflow using Git.  Don't 
execute Git commands without thinking about them.  When you're just 
starting out it is very easy to get things into an unpleasant state.  As
 long as you correctly added and committed your work in the past it is 
always possible to fix it.  I'm just suggesting to go slow and double 
check your commands before hitting enter.
					</p><p>  We're requiring you to use Git from the command line for a
 reason.  By typing in the raw commands yourself you're learning exactly
 what you're asking Git to do.  If you use Git from a GUI then you're 
just clicking buttons and don't really know what's going on.</p>
