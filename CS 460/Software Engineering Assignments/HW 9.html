						<li>Must build the database from script files that are maintained in your project under Git</li>

					"As a developer in this new world of cloud applications I want to 
write a database backed web application and deploy it in the cloud so I 
can prove my cloud skills and show I can do more than just local 
development/deployment."
				</p>
				<div class="questions">
					<h4>Questions/Tasks:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Begin with your finished HW 8.</li>
						<li>Create the database remotely on Azure.  For this and the next 
task you may find Chapter 13: Deployment to be especially helpful.  We 
will also cover this during class in Week 9.</li>
						<li>Deploy the web application on Azure.  It must use the database you deployed on Azure.</li>
						<li><p>You'll need an account on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Azure</a>.
  If you haven't done this before, you get a free account with $200 
credit.  This is more than plenty to cover this class for free.  Do use 
this resource wisely and remember, if something is provisioned or 
running you'll have to pay for it.  If it takes up storage or bandwidth 
the cloud provider will charge you for it somehow.  Part of this 
homework and tasks you'll do next term involve learning how to use cloud
 services properly.  Hint: when you're finished with something and don't
 need it anymore -- delete it.  If you'll need it in the future then 
just make sure it isn't running.</p> 
						<p>Many students last year used their Microsoft Imagine 
(DreamSpark) account on Azure.  They got free databases (otherwise 
they're $5/month.  If you need an account let me know.</p> </li>
						<li>To show how you did all this, take screenshots of all 
significant phases of setting this up and of your running site and put 
them in your Portfolio.  In addition, leave this web app running online 
until the end of finals week so it can be graded live.  Include a link 
to it in your Portfolio.</li>
