					<h4>Primary Objectives:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Be able to write a MVC web application <strong>that uses portions of a large, complex pre-existing database</strong></li>
						<li>Be able to derive C# models from an existing database using Entity Framework and “Code First with an Existing Database” workflow</li>
						<li>Be able to write LINQ queries using fluent syntax</li>
						<li>Learn to use C# language features: partial classes</li>
						<li>Use more Razor language features to build feature-laden views</li>
					</ol>

					<h4>Overall Requirements:</h4>
					<ul class="list-unstyled">
					    <li>You must use “Code First with an Existing Database” workflow</li>
						<li>Don't add and commit your database file (ignore it please; it's 205 MB)</li>
						<li>If you need to add something to a model class, do it in a new file (still in the model folder) and use a <code>partial</code> class</li>
						<li>Make this a single website, with a landing page and links as 
appropriate.  Remove unnecessary boilerplate and add in something to 
make it look like a prototype of a real system</li>
						<li>You should prefer strongly-typed views over untyped viewbag-only views</li>
						<li>Use only fluent LINQ syntax (dot notation) and <strong>not</strong> query syntax (the sql-like version)</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Questions/Tasks:</h4>
					<ol>
						<li><p><strike>Begin this homework by <a href="http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/">downloading</a></strike> and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt710790.aspx">extracting</a> the AdventureWorks 2014 example database <strike>from CodePlex.</strike> It's moved.  The database you want to use is the OLTP version from <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/adventure-works">here</a>.  (They moved sample databases from "CodePlex" to GitHub.)  Use the full database backup zip file version.</p><p>For a full description of the AdventureWorks "company" and database, see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms124825(v=sql.100).aspx">here</a>.</p></li>
						
						<li>Follow the steps shown in class, or here (for reference: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200620(v=vs.113).aspx">Entity Framework - Code First from Existing Database</a>) to create an empty MVC project, add the database and reverse engineer (generate) model classes.  We will only be using the <strong>Production</strong>
 subsystem, so I recommend you only generate model classes for that 
subsystem (something like 24 tables/classes plus the context class).</li>
						<li><strong>Feature 1: Browse Products</strong> <p class="user-story paper">As
 a potential customer who is visiting the website I would like to be 
able to browse to find products to buy.  I already know what category of
 product I want, I just want to pick an item in that category.</p>  <p>A
 user should easily be able to find products in the store/catalog and 
view details of that product.  The user does not want to search by 
keyword.  They want to browse by product category.  Products can be 
organized by top level category (<code>Production.ProductCategory</code>) and then by a sub-category (<code>Production.ProductSubcategory</code>).
  Don't show results until the user has selected both category and 
sub-category.  Then allow them to see a short listing of products (or a 
paged version), from which they can select or click on one to bring up a
 full product description, maybe with a review.  Kudos to anyone who can
 display the product photo.</p>  <p>For an example, go to nearly any large web store, say <a href="https://www.rei.com/">REI</a>.
  Click on Snow (the top level category), then click on Downhill Skiing 
(a subcategory).  You see a number of products.  Click on Arc'teryx 
Sabre Jacket - Men's to see a full description, yikes :-( $625!)  They 
have at least 2 levels of sub-categories where we have only 1, but you 
get the idea. (You can see the subcategories in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_(navigation)">breadcrumbs</a>.)</p><p>Your
 stakeholders have not given a preference as to what this should look 
like or how you do this, so it's your choice.  Do you use hyperlinks?  
Drop down (select) lists? What info do you show the user?  Well, 
certainly don't show them primary key or foreign key values, or internal
 things like FinishedGoodsFlag.  Should you show discontinued items?  
Probably not.  It's up to you.  Also, try to make it look decent please;
 the default auto-generated CRUD look won't cut it!</p></li>
						<li><strong>Feature 2: Add Review</strong>  <p>Let's see if we can insert to the database.  This user story describes what is needed.</p> <p class="user-story paper">As
 a customer who has purchased a product I would like to be able to write
 and submit a review of a particular product so others can read about my
 experience with the it.</p><p>For ease of implementation, assume the user knows the <code>Production.Product.ProductID</code>.
  Allow them to enter their name, email address, rating and a possibly 
lengthy comment/review.  When they correctly submit the information, 
insert it into the database and thank the user for their review (using 
POST/Redirect/GET).</p><p>You can integrate this feature with the browse
 functionality or not; it's up to you.  If you integrate it then the 
user won't have to know the product ID as you'll already have it.</p></li>
						<li>And by now you know the drill; put it all in your Portfolio.  
Do you know what would make the grader really happy?  A video of you 
demonstrating your website.  </li>
