### Homework 3

Homework 3 we are going to learn C#. We are first going to install Visual Studio and continue to work with Git. We are to use Visual Studio 2017 only! We are given a Java version on a program in which we will be translating it to C#. All our C# code must be commented with XML comments. We are not allowed to use Git commands from within Visual Studio only from the command line.
