### Homework 3

Homework 3 we are going to learn C#. We are first going to install Visual Studio and continue to work with Git. We are to use Visual Studio 2017 only! We are given a Java version on a program in which we will be translating it to C#. All our C# code must be commented with XML comments. We are not allowed to use Git commands from within Visual Studio only from the command line.


### Step 1: Installing Visual Studio 2017

Since I am using a MacBook Air mid 2013, I had to upgrade my macOS. The macOS I was using was OS X Yosemite. I had to upgrade to macOS High Sierra. After an hour of upgrading my macOS, I finally downloaded [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/).


### Step 2: Working with C#

Before starting we start working remember to create a new feature branch. I called my feature branch `hw3-branch`.
