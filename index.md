Welcome to my Portfolio
---

This will be my Portfolio of some projects I developed as a collage student here at Western Oregon University.


### About Me

Just a tad bit about myself is that I'm a very patient, kind-hearted person. I can play the piano but can't read notes. I have been in a church choir for over ten years now. I love to eat, play sports, and be a gamer.

As a Senior at Western Oregon University we are to create this Portfolio. We will be working on this Portfolio throughout the whole school year. This is our Senior Project in which we are to complete with hard work and dedication.
