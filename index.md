### About Me

Just a tad bit about myself is that I'm a very patient, kind-hearted person. I can play the piano but can't read notes. I have been in a  choir for over ten years now. I love to eat, play sports, play video games, and code!

As a Senior at Western Oregon University we are to create this Portfolio. We will be working on this Portfolio throughout the whole school year and take notes on how we did our work. This is our Senior Project in which we are to complete with hard work and dedication. The Senior Project is spread out into three courses.
